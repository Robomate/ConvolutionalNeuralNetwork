## Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Recognition


##### This is a MATLAB implementation of a convolutional neural network to classify images from standard datasets done as a part of our course project for CS663 Digital Image Processing. 


#### Data Sets Used :
- MNIST [Hand written digits data] as available [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
- STL-10 [10 Class Categorized Objects] as available  [here](http://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/).
- CIFAR-10 [10 Class Categorized Objects] as available 
[here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

Note that the data set and its preprocessed variant is included in the `data` directory of the repository.
    
#### Steps to Train and Test the CNN
- Clone the Repository.
- Run the `cnntrain.m` file with input `1, 2, 3` for different datasets.
- To visualize the Weight Filters and Pool Activation Features enable the `visualize` option.
