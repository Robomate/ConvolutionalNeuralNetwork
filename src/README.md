#Instructions to run the CNN and test
	1. Run the cnnTrain.m file with the default settings (for MNIST)
	2. Now if you want to run the code for STL and CIFAR , comment the lines for MNIST 
	   and uncomment the lines corrsponding to CIFAR /STL in the cnnTrain.m
	3. I will add the functionality of taking user input for the data set and hence accordingly doing it
	   in the file at a later stage.
